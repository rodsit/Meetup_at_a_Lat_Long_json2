# Meetup_at_a_Lat_Long_json2This retrieves JSPN from meetup and sticks it in a table on an Android device.

It works! - unlike many projects on github!! :)

Stick itin Android studio 2 and from their run it on your Android phone.

Let me know if it works!!! 

I will improve it - offer me something1
